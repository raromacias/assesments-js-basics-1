const analysisOfRequirements = "Part of planning which defines project goals through collection of end user requirements, working with business stakeholders in improving the existing system with a pros and con analysis, and finding solutions to meet specific user proposals."
const design = "Creating the architecture of a software system and its elements."
const implementation = "Building the software using a progamming language by the development team."
const testingAndIntegration ="Evaluating quality of software with aim of fixing defects and preparing the software to run and operate in a specific environment."
